# godot-go: Go bindings for Godot 4.1

[Go](https://golang.org/) bindings for the [Godot Game Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) cross-platform game engine. godot-go integrates into Godot through the Godot GDExtension API through cgo.

The project is currently under heavy development. The API should be considered __EXPERIMENTAL__ and is subject to change. The API is expected to become more stable as we get closer to a 1.0 release.

## Current State of the Project

Although the tests confirm positive results, the godot-go bindings are currently not useable until the __blocker__ [reference counting issue](https://github.com/godot-go/godot-go/issues/71) is fixed. Further development won't make much sense until this is addressed.

## Getting Started

Requirements:
* clang-format
* gcc
* go 1.19.x

### Building Godot-Go

In order for godot-go to work correctly, you must make sure the godot_headers are in sync between your godot binary and godot-go. Development is built and tested off of [Godot 4.1 stable](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.1/). There are breaking changes from the Godot 4.0 GDExtension interface. Please make sure to run godot-go against Godot 4.1+.


    # exports the latest gdextension_interface.h and extension_api.json from the godot binary
    GODOT=/godot_folder_path/bin/godot make update_godot_headers_from_binary

    # generates code for wrapping gdextension_interface.h and extension_api.json
    make generate

    # build godot-go
    make build


### Test

Once the project successfully builds, run the following commands to generate cached files for the test demo project for the first time (don't be concerned if it fails):

    make ci_gen_test_project_files

From here on out, you will just need to run the following command to iteratively test:

    make test

This will run the demo project in the test directory.

## Contact

I'm happy to help out anyone interested in the project. Please leave a message in the [Discussion boards](https://github.com/godot-go/godot-go/discussions) or you can add me (surgical#3758) as a friend on the [Godot Engine Discord](https://discord.gg/qZHMsDg) servers. I primarily frequent the **gdnative-dev** room.
