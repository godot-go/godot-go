# godot-go: Go bindings for Godot 4

[Go](https://golang.org/) bindings for the [Godot Game Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) cross-platform game engine. godot-go integrates into Godot through the Godot GDExtension API through cgo.

The project is currently under heavy development. The API should be considered __EXPERIMENTAL__ and is subject to change. The API is expected to become more stable as we get closer to a 1.0 release.


## Getting Started

Requirements:
* clang-format
* gcc

### Building from Source

To quickly build from source, check out the code and run the following commands:

    make generate && make build

### Test

Once the project successfully builds, run the following commands to test:

    make test

This will run the demo project in the test directory

## Contact

I'm happy to help out anyone interested in the project. You can add me (surgical#3758) as a friend on the [Godot Engine Discord](https://discord.gg/qZHMsDg) servers. I primarily frequent the **gdnative-dev** room.
